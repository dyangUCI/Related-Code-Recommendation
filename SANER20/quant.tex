\subsection{Commonly co-occurring code}

We collect the original GitHub files which contain the similar counterparts, then we extract all co-occurred methods from these GitHub files. For each co-occurring in each GitHub file, we cluster its similar counterparts from other files. We keep only the clusters with size of at least two and return the remaining clusters in descending order of size.

For 11,110 out of 21K SO queries, we can retrieve related code fragments from GitHub. That is, using our SO query code base and GitHub search code corpus, we can find commonly co-occurring code for 52.4\% of the queries. The SO queries have a median of 24 commonly co-occurring methods in GitHub and a mean of 74. The retrieved methods have a median of 12 average lines of code, and a mean of 14 average lines of code. The distribution of number of related methods and distribution of average lines of code are shown in Figure \ref{fig:num-related} and \ref{fig:avg-loc} respectively.

From the figures we can see that a SO query is most likely to have less than ten commonly co-occurring code fragments, and most of the SO queries have less than 50 commonly co-occurring methods in GitHub. Most related methods for a query will have five to thirty average lines of code.
