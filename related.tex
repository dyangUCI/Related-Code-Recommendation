Various code search techniques have been proposed to discover relevant code components (e.g., functions, code snippets) given a user query. For example, given a keyword query, Portfolio retrieves function definitions and their usages using a combination of a PageRank model and an association model~\cite{mcmillan2011portfolio}. Chan et al. improve Portfolio by matching the textual similarity between containing nodes in an API usage subgraph with a keyword query~\cite{chan2012searching}. CodeHow also finds code snippets relevant to a natural language query. It explores API documents to identify relationships between query terms and APIs~\cite{lv2015codehow}. Instead of using natural language queries, several techniques automatically recommend relevant code snippets based on contextual information such as types in a target program~\cite{Holmes2005, sahavechaphan2006xsnippet, thummalapenta2007parseweb, ponzanelli2014mining}. CodeGenie is a test-driven code search technique that allows developers to specify desired functionality via test cases and then matches relevant methods and classes with the given test~\cite{lazzarini2009applying}. To more precisely capture search intent, S6 allows developers to express desired functionality using a combination of input-output types, test cases, and keyword descriptions~\cite{reiss2009semantics}.

Code-to-code search tools are most related to our technique among all different kinds of code search techniques. Given a code snippet as input, FaCoY~\cite{kim2018Facoy} finds semantically similar code snippets in a Stack Overflow dataset by first matching with accompanied natural language descriptions in related posts instead of matching code directly. Unlike FaCoY, several techniques infer an underlying code search pattern from a given code fragment~\cite{zhang2015interactive, MKM:11, meng2013lase, sivaraman2019active}. Sydit generalizes concrete identifiers (e.g., variable names, types, and method calls) in a given code example as an abstract code template and identifies other similar locations via AST-based tree matching~\cite{MKM:11}. Lase uses multiple code examples instead of a single example to better infer the search intent of a user~\cite{meng2013lase}. Critics allows developers to construct an AST-based search pattern from a single example through manual code selection, customization, and parameterization~\cite{zhang2015interactive}. These code-to-code search tools focus on identifying relevant code snippets that are syntactically or semantically similar to a given code snippet. However, since many programming tasks (e.g., password encryption and decryption) require multiple code snippets or functions to work together, none of the existing techniques recommend code snippets that complement a given code snippet to complete desired functionality.
